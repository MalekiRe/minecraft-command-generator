# minecraft-command-generator
A scratch like interface for minecraft commands

If you do not have java you may have to install the Java Runtime Enviroment.
This program comes pre-installed with minecraft commands and two different programs, the Minecraft Command Generator
and the Minecraft MutliBlock Structure Generator. These both come in Jar files and as the source code. In order to view the source code in
JGrasp you must install both JGrasp, or another IDE, or even Notepad++ and download the Java JDK by following the instructions on the website.
https://openjdk.java.net/install/
And same for JGrasp
